**Product funnel analysis:**

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

1. How many times was each product viewed?
2. How many times was each product added to cart?
3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
4. How many times was each product purchased?
5. Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.
