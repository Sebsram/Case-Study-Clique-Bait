**Product funnel analysis:**

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:

1. How many times was each product viewed?
2. How many times was each product added to cart?
3. How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
4. How many times was each product purchased?
5. Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

For this part of the project, we only need to use two of the tables available. Events and Page_Hierarchy  as they both contain all the values neccesary to perform our calculations.
